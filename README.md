# WordPress - Starting Files

This file contains the basic templates to get you started building your WordPress site. 

This folder contains the following:
- index.php
- style.css
- functions.php
- header.php
- footer.php

Each of these templates contain generic starting code that was taught in class, as well can be found in the Lecture Slides: **Setting up &amp; Starting Your First WordPress Website** on Moodle. 

**Note**: the @package and @since have been left with filler content, you will need to fill in those details. The same goes for the pathing for enqueuing your additional styles and scripts.
